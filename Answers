2. A Mariadb 10.3 Galera cluster with three nodes requires a schema change that, if put through normally, will block queries to a frequently accessed table and bring down the API. If this change is backwards compatible with the existing queries made to the database, what steps, being specific, would you take to roll out the new schema?

Begin by ensuring your application is compatible with both the old and new database schemas. Using tools like pt-online-schema-change, which create new empty copies of tables to be altered, applying the desired changes and then copying rows from the original table in small batches, significantly reduces downtime. Apply these changes to one server at a time, allowing the others to handle requests and avoid downtime. After updating all servers, remove any temporary compatibility code from your application. It's also prudent to start with a recent backup of your database. This step acts as a safety net against any unexpected complications that might arise during the schema change process.
